## Preface

Now that we have the following data structure from our [previous post](./2023-06-28-sanitizer.md), we can create the logic to retrieve the  start of the packet marker.

The start of the packet is a sequence of four unique characters that are all different.

## Design

We now that we need to get the position of the first character after the start of packet sequence. So we need to iterate through
the stream while checking if the subsequent four characters are all unique. Which in pseudo-code could look like this

```
datastream = "mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb"

for (int i = 0; i < datastream.length - 3; i++) {
    char1 = datastream[i]
    char2 = datastream[i + 1]
    char3 = datastream[i + 2]
    char4 = datastream[i + 3]

    firstCharMatches = char1 == char2 || char1 == char3 || char1 == char4
    secondCharMatches = char2 == char3 || char2 == char4
    thirdCharMatches = char3 == char4
}
```

However, if we start digging trough the Kotlin documentation for character or list operations we see the `windowed` method. 

> Returns a list of snapshots of the window of the given size sliding along this collection with the given step, where each snapshot is a list.
> - [Jetbrains](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/windowed.html)

So this means we can use the `windows` method to slide across our list by one character at a time, while validating that the four characters we retrieve are all unique.

To check if characters are unique we can use the `toSet` method on the `CharSequence` we get inside the `windowed` lambda.
In Kotlin a Set has the benefit of not supporting duplicate elements [(Jetbrains, n.d.)](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-set/#kotlin.collections.Set).

So if we take our `CharSequence` of four elements and turn it into a set, we should only get a set of four items when all four chars are unique. So with that knowledge, lets rewrite the psuedo-code again.

```
datastream = "mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb"

datastream.windowed(size = 4, step = 1) { charSequence ->
    if (charSequence.toSet().size == 4) {
        // We now have four unique characters
    }
}
```

This does look a lot cleaner, so let's start implementing it in actual Kotlin code.

## Implementation

### Business logic

Now we have an idea of our design, let's start implementing it in our PartOne class.

```kotlin
class PartOne(
    private val sanitizer: Sanitizer
) {
    fun getFirstMarkerPosition(): Int {
        val chunkSize = 4           // Step 1
        var currentIndex = -1
        var firstMarkerPosition = -1

        sanitizer.getDatastreamBuffers()?.windowed(chunkSize, step = 1, partialWindows = true) { // Step 2
            currentIndex++ // Step 3

            if (it.toSet().size == chunkSize && firstMarkerPosition <= 0) { // Step 4
                firstMarkerPosition = currentIndex + chunkSize // Step 5
            }
        }

        return firstMarkerPosition
    }
}
```
{: file="aoc-2022/day6/src/main/kotlin/aoc/PartOne.kt" }

At _Step 1_ we declare all variables which we need outside of our `windowed` method. The `chunkSize` is the size of the marker packet, which was `4` according to the assignment. To get the first marker position, we need to keep a count of the current index, which will start at `-1` because at the first iteration before any check, it's incremented at _Step 3_.

Then at _Step 2_ we iterate through our data stream buffers using the `windowed` method. In the method we give the chunkSize, which is the size of the marker, the step, which is the number of elements we shift each iteration, and finally we set `partialWindows` to `true`, this ignores the chunkSize at the end of the list when there are less than four items [(Jetbrains, n.d.)](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/windowed.html).

To check if our current window of chars are unique, we turn them into a set at _Step 4_ and validate that the set size is equal to the chunkSize, which was the number of characters needed to determine the start of packet marker. We also validate that the `firstMarkerPosition` hasn't a value higher than `0` to make sure we only update that variable once. So if there are more than one sequences of four characters that are unique, we only get the index of the first one. At _Step 5_ we set the `firstMarkerPosition` to the `currentIndex` plus the `chunkSize`, because the currentIndex is the index that the marker starts at but to retrieve the index of the first message we need to add the start of packet marker size to the index.

### Test case

We have written our business logic, and for our test input we now that the expected output for the test data is `7`. So we can start to write our test case.

```kotlin
class PartOneTest {
    @Test
    fun testGetFirstMarkerPosition() {
        // Arrange
        val resource = {}::class.java.getResource("/input_part_one.txt")
        val sanitizer = Sanitizer(resource)
        val sut = PartOne(sanitizer)
        val expectedPosition = 5

        // Act
        val result = sut.getFirstMarkerPosition()

        // Assert
        assertEquals(expectedPosition, result)
    }
}
```
