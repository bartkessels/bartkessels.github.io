In the Netherlands it’s almost time for the summer vacation, which means that it’s
time to think about what our plans this summer are going to be. My girlfriend and I
have been talking about where we want to go and finally decided to do something we’ve
never done before, backpacking. 

We both have camped outside before, albeit in our backyards or at campings. We both could
see the beauty of being in the moment all by (y)ourself out in the wilderness. So the decision
was made, we’re going to Sweden for three weeks.

And as I said, we’ve never backpacked before so I’m going to document our journey of starting
off backpacking on my website hoping it might help you making a decision whether or not you’re
going to enjoy it. And I like sharing all of our adventures with you so there’s something in it
for me as well.
