## The leg

Our third and first to last leg of this vacation starts in Vierlingsbeek and goes all the way to Gennep.

In Afferden there is again a small detour for our camping, but that doesn't lead to the actual camping. Something has gone wrong when changing this route to include the camping. So please don't rely on this route if you're planning to camp in Afferden. You'll have to find a camping by yourself (which isn't that hard in Afferden).
