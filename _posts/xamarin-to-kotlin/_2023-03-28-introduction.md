# But why?

We'll you might ask yourself, why would you move to Kotlin? We'll the obvious reason being the end of support of Xamarin in 2024 [(Microsoft, 2022)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/xamarin#microsoft-support).
But the company I work for is moving towards Kotlin with Jetpack Compose as the new standard for developing Android applications.

This is actually a very good move, because the decision to use Xamarin for their mobile apps was made about 10 years ago. At that time the mobile space wasn't that
thought out and it wasn't certain what platform they were going to use. So a cross platform framework like Xamarin seemed pretty obvious as the developers where already
acquainted with .NET. But forward a couple of years and instead of using the cross platform features of Xamarin, the development was all headed towards Xamarin.Android as
the only devices that would get the apps where (managed) Android devices.

So hence the decision now to move towards a native mobile development platform.

# History

So a bit of history of myself, before I finished school I used to have a company with a friend of mine where we'd build native apps for Android and iOS. So the first
couple of years I was building Android applications in Java without knowing anything about design patterns or how the Android lifecycle really worked.

But for the time being it was fine, as we weren't building really big apps. At the time it was just an app for a local gym club.
